# Pyodide Editor

A quick and dirty example of implementing a client-side Python Editor complete with Unit Testing and Math-related libraries. Be sure to read the comments in the exampleData folder and the helpers folder.

Implementation relies on Pyodide and Monaco-Editor. We're running Pyodide from a Web Worker. 

## Getting Started

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Navigate yourself to https://localhost:3000 and wait for the product to initialize. Once it's done, you should see the example data loaded into the Editor. Feel free to Run, Plot, or Test it.
